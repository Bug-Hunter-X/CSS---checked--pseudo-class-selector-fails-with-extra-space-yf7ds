The solution is simple: remove the extra space between the selector and the opening curly brace:

```css
input[type="checkbox"]:checked{
  background-color: green; /*This will work*/
}
```

By ensuring there is no space between the `:checked` pseudo-class and the opening curly brace `{` the styles will be applied correctly.
